Also provides end user devices including Notebooks, Gaming books, Touchpads and Google Chromebooks. Hypers has developed a Digital- IP-Appliance Design Process along with a utility, being the Appliance Optimizer Utility (AOU), which together accelerates the development of appliance-solutions  Hyperscalers offers choice across two open hardware architectures:   Each architecture is complete with network, compute, storage and converged GP GPU infrastructure elements . Customers are able to realize significant efficiencies and cost savings that are both immediate and ongoing . Many can be “test-driven” using HypersCalers LaaS software and pre-built (customizable) configurations . Hyperscale x86 x86  Tier 1 Original x86 Lab as a Service lab as a service is now available in the U.S. It is free from vendor lock in and is open / free from Vendor lock in . The company’s in-house IP Appliance Design Process was validated in partnership with associated major software manufacturers .  Hyperscalers appliance solutions are ideally suited to IaaS PaaS and SaaS providers looking to implement their services from anywhere . The IBM / Intel PC architecture was once synonymous with open hardware standards and provided an escape route from the deeply proprietary system architectures that existed beforehand . More recently, household name OEM vendors have quietly implemented a widespread and systematic lock down of every possible facet in their server, storage and network system system ranges and even devices before being re-branded and on-sold to unsuspecting customers . Sadly, we have now come full circle in the proprietary cycle of evolution. It is the customer who bears the cost to support this supposed “value added work” It is really just a new evolution of the same old proprietary lock-in  Hyperscalers is the world’s first OEM offering the full IT spectrum under a new open x86 supply alternative to the traditional locked vendors . Digital-IP owners need to rapidly productize their ICT-appliance products for delivery into the conventional and hyperscale data center context very quickly, reliably and at a fraction of historical costs . The practical impacts of this are:   In the absence of fully open supply chains, commercial and internal-IT service providers continue to travel down the path of impleveal . The absence of an open supply chain means that standardization and its inherent benefits are challenging to realize. This means  standardization  is challenging to . realize. The lack of standardization is difficult to realize  Hyperscalers' IP Appliance Design Process and associated Appliance Optimizer Utility work together to productize IT-appliances for Digital-IP owners needing to operationalize their services quickly, reliably and at a fraction of historical costs . 100% of HypersCalers business is managed through a dedicated channel to market . The resultant product solutions embody the Hypersalers open supply chain philosophy, meaning that they become cheaper to own and operate over their operational lifetimes .

You are happy to host your applications and data in a 3rd party data center . Your current IT infrastructure will struggle to handle the workloads .

You struggle to hire developers and .sysadmins with cloud skills with cloud skill skills . Your project needs to get up  Using licensed operating system software to create virtual machine instances in the cloud means costs can quickly spiral out of control .

The current IT environment is plagued with inefficiencies characterized by low asset utilization, a fragmented demand for resources, duplicative systems, duplicate systems, unmanageable environments and long procurement lead times . Cloud computing has the potential to play a major part in addressing these inefficiencyiencies and improving service delivery. But, Cloud is changing at the speed of light. Chief Technology Officers and Chief Information Officers say Public Cloud adoption presents serious business-limitations around: loss of control, security and data sovereignty, latency and cost. When When Cloud adoption is complete, it will be at a cost of  CTOs and CIOs identify project-risk and complexities due to a lack of standardisation, risk of vendor lock-in, lengthy lead times as well as a high capex . HyperScalers CEO George Cvetanovski said: \"If Cloud-datacenters were like cars, each of us would be heavily reliant on a unique vehicle, providing us with insight into the root problems of custom, one-time engineered outcomes, be it from a build-quality and safety perspective, a performance and efficiency perspective or an economies of scale and cost savings perspective\" He said \"Information Technology's core problem, I'm talking about the problem of complexity is being solved simply through standardisation of best practices and through economies  IT's Cloud-Path of Least Resistance = OCP Compliant (proprietry-free) Built Cloud(s) came in second followed by Public Cloud service providers . The matrix's finding affirms CIOs' and CTOs' need and preference for delivering the full suite of Amazon-like Cloud services only under their full control and without the limitations of the Public Cloud model including: security and data-sovereignty, latency and cost . The decision to partner with Quanta QCT- the world's largest Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) - was a 'no-brainer' QCT's pioneering ideas and engineering excellence help meet HyperScalers' and its channel-partners' and their clients' needs .  Open Compute Project was started by Facebook three years ago with a pretty big goal: to build one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost . The result is a data center full of vanity free servers which is 38% more efficient and 24% less expensive to build and run than other state-of-the-art datacenters .

        "output": " Tier 1 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) systematically re-brand and lock down every hardware and/or software facet that is relevant to their business model . Proprietary storage servers are often completely locked at all levels – hardware, firmware and software . This includes from the chassis all the way down to CPUs, NICs, RAM, DACs, SSDs and even HDDs . In the network domain, most proprietary switches cannot run a different network operating system . The effort required on the part of proprietary vendors to lock up third party (from their perspective) hardware and firmware, platforms and commodities is significant and costly . This effort is ultimately funded by their customers within the pricing of equipment and service of equipment, equipment and services .  Hyperscalers was created in the context of the new world of open hardware and software - in particular, the Open Compute Project . This project seeks to level the playing field for modern compute, storage and network equipment in the same way that the open source movement has done in the software world . This applies across both Tier 1 and hyperscale technologies, both in the form of Tier 1 . s purchased from these OEMs . Customers are essentially funding their OEMs to force them to make all future related purchases from those same . same OEMs. How can this possibly be in the best interests of you, the customer? We understand that the normal cycle of business evolution can often result in financial & economic priorities eventually taking precedence over engineering decisions .  Hyperscalers is proud to use only the highest quality chassis, component and commodity items . Customers are free to select and install any genuine CPU, DIMM, SSD, HDD, NIC and so on . Our OEM customers are completely free also to rebrand and lock things down if they want to (something we don’t go out of our way to encourage) - We ourselves never re-brand or lock-down any appliance - software or hardware . We are an active part of the open community and we believe whole-heartedly that this the right path forward to enable us to support the new and evolving world of advanced service delivery. We want our customers to know what they are getting - the best. port and attend - i.e  The nature of equipment lifecycle refresh planning is evolving beyond warranty-driven 3-year “rip and replace” cycles .
