Each node can accommodate SATADOMs for the operating system and up to two extra hot-swappable SSD/HDDs for cache or data storage. The RAID-ready configuration of Rackgo X Leopard Snow preserves data integrity and avoids data corruption. Rackgo X Leopard Snow enables scale out on compute storage and switch. With integrated IntelÂ® Red Rock Canyon (RRC) on the central node Rackgo X Leopard Snow supports three 100G LAN ports. RRC is essentially switch silicon that aggregates I/O from all four nodes in a server sled and enables interconnections among the four nodes. By centralizing power supplies in the rack and removing unnecessary components from the system the Rackgo X Leopard Snow enhances system MTBF by 58% compared to other conventional 2U4N systems on the market. This will avoid system downtime caused by component failure and minimize maintenance efforts.

As these computing facilities began connecting with each other in the 70s telecommunication companies began to offer floor space to such customers as an outsource service referred to as co-location (Co-Lo) services. Co-Lo operators went on to experience the 80âs boom followed by the bust of the 90â then the passing of Y2K in 00â. Now in the 10â the competitive landscape between: Cloud service providers managed services providers and enterprise service providers have contributed to a relatively poor take-up of technical real-estate. Despite these dynamics Co-Lo-operators have not changed in principle since the â70s. And perhaps there was no good reason to change. Up until now: In the new Hyperscale era of service providers driven by automation analytics intelligence and connected devices.

        "output": "About Us Hyperscalers is a global cloud-to-edge infrastructure provider offering an open-supply-chain-alternative to traditional proprietary vendors. âWhat does this difference mean to your business\" You attain the combined benefits of vanity-free procurement that is free of hardware lock ins and free of software locks ins. Hyperscalers provides two types of hardware architectures: Hyperscale and Tier 1 Original. Each is complete with networking server storage hyperconverged and GPU infrastructure systems. Hyperscalers also provides end user devices including Notebooks Gaming books Touchpads and Google Chromebooks. Hyperscalers has developed a Digital- IP-Appliance Design Process along with a utility being the Appliance Optimizer Utility (AOU)which together accelerates the development of appliance-solutions for use by cloud service provides managed service providers and original equipment manufacturers needing to hyperscale their services very quickly reliably and at a fraction of traditional cost. Hyperscalers offers choice across two open hardware architectures: Each architecture is complete with network compute storage and converged GP GPU infrastructure elements and is open / free from vendor lock in. BareMetal & Ethernet Switches Hyperscale x86 Tier 1 Original x86 Lab as a Service LaaS IP Appliance Design Process CPU RAM SSD HDD NVMe Notebooks Touchpads Chromebooks Services and Support Education Whitepapers Training Videos In contrast to the use of traditional OEM vendorsâ hardware architectures that are locked down and non-interoperable by design Hyperscalers customers are able to realize significant efficiencies and cost savings that are both immediate and ongoing. Hyperscalersâ appliance solutions are packaged complete with hardware software and pre-built (customizable) configurations. These were all pre-engineered using an in-house IP Appliance Design Process and validated in partnership with associated major software manufacturers. Many can be âtest-driven\" using Hyperscalers Lab as a Service (LaaS). Hyperscalers appliance solutions are ideally suited to IaaS PaaS and SaaS providers looking to implement their services from anywhere. Enterprise end computing devices. The IBM / Intel PC architecture was once synonymous with open hardware standards and provided an escape route from the deeply proprietary system architectures that existed beforehand. More recently household name OEM vendors have quietly since implemented a widespread and systematic lock down of every possible facet in their server storage and network system ranges and even devices before being re-branded and on-sold to unsuspecting customers. Sadly we have now come full circle in the proprietary cycle of evolution. It is the customer who bears the cost to support this supposed âvalue added work\" which is really just a new evolution of the same old proprietary lock-in. Clearly these practices are a regressive step for customers who now find themselves exactly where they were twenty or thirty years ago locked into a yellow brick road designed for them by their vendors. Hyperscalers is the worldâs first OEM offering the full IT spectrum under a new open x86 supply alternative to the traditional locked vendors. Hyperscalers offers a direct procurement alternative to identical but expense multiplied locked and re-branded hardware offered by lock in oriented vendors. The practical impacts of this are: In todayâs fast paced and rapidly evolving product market Digital-IP owners need to rapidly productize their ICT-appliance products for delivery into the conventional and hyperscale data center context very quickly reliably and at a fraction of historical costs. Unfortunately the industry landscape is dominated by various competing interests of OEM vendors who have locked down their systems and components. This means that standardization and its inherent benefits are challenging to realize. In the absence of fully open supply chains commercial and internal-IT service providers continue to travel down the path of implementing expensive ad-hock engineered solutions. Hyperscalers provides a solution to this problem through the IP Appliance Design Process. The Hyperscalers IP Appliance Design Process and associated Appliance Optimizer Utility work together to productize IT-appliances for Digital-IP owners needing to operationalize their services quickly reliably and at a fraction of historical costs. Additionally the resultant product solutions embody the Hyperscalers open supply chain philosophy meaning that they become cheaper to own and operate over their operational lifetimes. 100% of Hyperscalers business is managed through a dedicated channel to market. This means that there is always a partner organization between Hyperscalers and the end customer defined as Small to Medium Enterprises SME or larger or Small to Medium Business SMB or larger. Here's a list of our partner-customers. They include SI MSP Cloud Telco Digital IP owners and OEM. Copyright Â© Hyperscalers AUS HyperScalers. All rights reserved."

Through our support we are honoured to have played a part in providing a platform for athletes like Michelle to shine and inspire others. Her success is a powerful reminder that you should never overlook the underdog - be it in sports or in the business world. Like Michelle Hyperscalers is a testament to what passion hard work and a bit of belief can achieve no matter the odds. As we celebrate Michelle's remarkable achievements and look forward to her dazzling performance at the Paris we are reminded of the impact of our support and the importance of investing in excellence. Hyperscalers much like Michelle is proof that greatness comes from never underestimating the potential within. To Michelle and the entire Canberra United team thank you for exemplifying the spirit of perseverance and excellence.

Even in the context of the big three public cloud behemoths opportunities still exist to provide superior capabilities and pricing. It might seem challenging to many but this is where we believe that we can add value and assist you to convince customers and investors of the validity of your cloud product roadmap. These four (4) steps road-map guides CEO CTO and cloud operators through a journey of transitioning their public cloud business over to a new state - one that is built around a sustainable competitive advantage. Implementing a Multi-Cloud Strategy is necessary to service the compute storage and networking needs of the entire market for SME and SMB across any: Recommended Solution - Start by partnering with AWS Microsoft and Google so that instances of your software-IP become readily procurable from the footprints of these macro service providers. Naturally this depends on you building testing and releasing machine images containing your software-IP such that they can be selected and procured by your customers from within the product catalogs of these macro service providers. Providing your software-IP on Hyperscale or Tier 1 hardware is a step that allows your customers to implement your software-IP within the perimeter of their own premises thereby satisfying any strenuous security or availability requirements that they may have. OEM-branding opportunities are available (for your brand) across our entire range of holistic appliances on Tier 1 Original and Hyperscale hardware. When it comes to commoditizing your software-IP Hyperscalers offers two paths: â¢ Lab to You is a laboratory that is transported out to your premises on loan with all network storage compute and GP-GPU systems needed to qualify your software-IP on an in-house basis. Engineering support is provided by Hyperscalers â¢ HS-Labs are permanent laboratories within our premises at Hyperscalers. These facilities are made available to all Hyperscalersâ channel partners including software makers seeking a special level of support for their PoC. In order to commoditize the worldâs hottest software-IP Hyperscalers has developed both a design process methodology and also the Virtual Machine Performance Management Utility (VMPMU) to support development and validation of Hyperscale appliance designs. Appliances developed through our methodology and toolset offer SDDC IaaS PaaS SaaS providers a newfound means of efficiently activating capacity from any datacenter floor - quickly reliably and at a fraction of historical costs.

LaaS is ideal for enterprises needing to test-drive real workloads on multiple existing appliances with the view of finding the right solution mix for their business. LaaS is available either over the internet via WAN (Public Cloud) or from within Hyperscalersâ network - LAN (Private Cloud). Once your software appliance has been created and validated Hyperscalers (with permission) will make it available to participating Co-Lo 2.0 operators. This means that enterprise customers of participating Co-Lo 2.0 operators can: â¢ Find and test-drive your appliance via the Hyperscalers LaaS environment â¢ Attain a holistic solution price inclusive of: Software- infrastructure IT-infrastructure and DC-infrastructure. This is possible through an easy to use drag and drop method for selecting products â¢ Select a preferred operator who will operate and service the appliance from within the Co-Loâs premises. Available options include IT (recommended) you the IP-owner or a qualified 3rd party. Implementation within a customerâs on-premise facility is the deepest possible form of product acquisition. The following options exist to select a preferred on-premise operator: IT (recommended) you (the IP-owner) or a qualified 3rd party.

        "output": "Rackgo X Rackgo X An Innovative Open Rack Solution Inspired by OCP The cloud is changing at the speed of light. Chief Technology Officers working on datacenter build-out say data growth lack of space and power and cooling issues are their biggest challenges. Conventional datacenter hardware cannot keep up with the growing density and large capacity requirements of datacenter operators who are looking for more efficient and simplified hardware design. QCT's pioneering ideas and engineering excellence help meet their needs. The Rackgo X is a 21\" open rack solution inspired by the Open Compute Project (OCP http://www.opencompute.org/ a project initiated by Facebook in 2011) standard. It is designed to deliver hyperscale datacenter performance for low CAPEX and OPEX with simplicity energy and cooling efficiency high density serviceability scalability and manageability. The Rackgo X is ideally suited for cloud architecture such as cloud service providers or large enterprise datacenters. Increased Efficiency with Unique Open Rack Design The Rackgo X is an open rack solution that integrates QCT's server storage and top-of-rack switch. Meant to optimize capital efficiency its simple and vanity-free design eliminates excessive features that do not contribute to overall performance. The Rackgo X features a wider open rack width of 21 inches. Compared to conventional 19-inch rack solutions it provides higher compute density greater storage capacity and increased airflow which improves cooling efficiency. The Rackgo X equips centralized power supplies (PSU) on the rack. All nodes share the centralized power supplies providing lower capital cost and high energy efficiency. Serviceability and Easy Maintenance Designed for easy cold aisle operation most service parts are tool-less and can be replaced in the front aisle. The Rackgo X boasts serviceability. Compared to conventional design where each node equips its own power supply unit (PSU) the Rackgo X's centralized PSU in the rack greatly reduces total PSUs. Its vanity-free design eliminates excessive components and reduces the total component number resulting in lower capital cost minimized maintenance efforts and a better mean time between failures (MTBF). Manageability The QCT Rackgo X allows datacenter operators to monitor the hardware status through a single point of contact with its best-in-class easy-to- use management tool. More Compute Storage and Network Switch Options Like the LEGO concept Rackgo X provides modular units to be built on each other. The QCT Rackgo X includes options of compute server microserver JBOD storage and QuantaMesh network switches as the basic building blocks. Customers can choose componenets to fit the specific needs of their datacenter applications. To help customers get started with the Rackgo X open rack solutions quickly QCT offers three rack architectures to suit different types of workloads. Datacenter customers can choose from the three rack configurations or build their own racks. Copyright Â© Hyperscalers AUS HyperScalers. All rights reserved."

As these computing facilities began connecting with each other in the 70s telecommunication companies began to offer floor space to such customers as an outsource service referred to as co-location (Co-Lo) services.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Open OEM Vs Locked OEM Just a handful of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) make all Intel x86 based equipment globally. Tier 1 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as HP Dell and Cisco (amongst many others) then systematically re-brand and lock down every hardware and/or software facet that is relevant to their business model. Many appliances come preloaded with locked firmware and software making it impossible to re-purpose these devices later. Proprietary storage servers are often completely locked at all levels - hardware firmware and software. This includes from the chassis all the way down to CPUs NICs RAM DACs SSDs and even HDDs. In the network domain most proprietary switches cannot run a different network operating system. The effort required on the part of proprietary OEM vendors to lock up third party (from their perspective) hardware firmware software platforms and commodities is significant and costly. This effort is ultimately funded by their customers within the pricing of equipment and services purchased from these OEMs. Customers are essentially therefore funding their OEMs to subsequently force them to make all future related purchases from those same OEMs. How can this possibly be in the best interests of you the customer We understand that the normal cycle of business evolution can often result in financial & economic priorities eventually taking precedence over engineering decisions and customer satisfaction. Hyperscalers was created in the context of the new world of open hardware and software - in particular the Open Compute Project. This project seeks to level the playing field for modern compute storage and network equipment in the same way that the open source movement has done in the software world. This applies across both Tier 1 and hyperscale technologies. Hyperscalers lives and breathes this philosophy not just with respect to branding but especially also in terms of the underlying supply partnerships that are the basis of our business and also the industry events that we support and attend - i.e the people that we mix with. We are an active part of the open community and we believe whole-heartedly that this the right path forward to enable us to support the new and evolving world of advanced service delivery. Hyperscalers differentiates itself to our customers in two main ways: - We never re-brand nor lock-down our products. Hyperscalers is proud to use only the highest quality chassis component and commodity items. We want our customers to know what they are getting - the best. Customers are free to select and install any genuine CPU DIMM SSD HDD NIC and so on. Our OEM customers are completely free also to rebrand and lock things down if they want to (something we donât go out of our way to encourage). - We ourselves however never re-brand or lock-down any appliance - software or hardware. Customers are free to swap out the Network Operating System NOS and install another one. They are also free to swap out the hypervisor orchestration file system or operating system layers for whatever else they wish to use. The nature of equipment lifecycle refresh planning is evolving beyond warranty-driven 3-year ârip and replace\" cycles. Eliminating the roadblock of locked in technology sunk costs is a key element in this.

So we know the costs. The TCO of a public cloud Vs a private cloud is no different. It is the same for the same capacity cloud. In fact you need to build a private cloud first before it could become a public cloud whereby third parties can begin consuming.' Back when Amazon selling books CD amongst a vast number of other things required even more datacenters to meet the ever-growing number of products and shoppers it created AWS Amazon Web Services to meet this demand. AWS was amongst the first to use Open Stack and Orchestration to unify its pool of Network Storage and Compute resources. And in doing so could for the first time account for consumption | usage of Amazon's many Business Units each with unique needs for VM and containers. Contrary to what many believe AWS was created to meet the needs for internal customers first before it could meet the needs of external customers. In other words even if you are planning a public cloud on day one you first need to build a private cloud - on an own LAN before third parties could access these resources via the WAN as part of a public cloud. Whilst an understanding of the different cost structures is very important awareness around the limitations of the public cloud is just as important if not more particularly for SME end customers more so than SMB. These include: Defined as hardware in use or planned to be in use by the Tier 1 OEM Defined as hardware used by the macro service providers: Facebook Microsoft Google Comparing the costs of one cloud provider Vs the next can be a daunting exercise for end-customers. Cloud service providers offer different cost models with the view of differentiating-between more so than any intent to confuse their customers.

        "output": "Rackgo X Rackgo X An Innovative Open Rack Solution Inspired by OCP The cloud is changing at the speed of light. Chief Technology Officers working on datacenter build-out say data growth lack of space and power and cooling issues are their biggest challenges. Conventional datacenter hardware cannot keep up with the growing density and large capacity requirements of datacenter operators who are looking for more efficient and simplified hardware design. QCT's pioneering ideas and engineering excellence help meet their needs. The Rackgo X is a 21\" open rack solution inspired by the Open Compute Project (OCP http://www.opencompute.org/ a project initiated by Facebook in 2011) standard. It is designed to deliver hyperscale datacenter performance for low CAPEX and OPEX with simplicity energy and cooling efficiency high density serviceability scalability and manageability. The Rackgo X is ideally suited for cloud architecture such as cloud service providers or large enterprise datacenters. Increased Efficiency with Unique Open Rack Design The Rackgo X is an open rack solution that integrates QCT's server storage and top-of-rack switch. Meant to optimize capital efficiency its simple and vanity-free design eliminates excessive features that do not contribute to overall performance. The Rackgo X features a wider open rack width of 21 inches. Compared to conventional 19-inch rack solutions it provides higher compute density greater storage capacity and increased airflow which improves cooling efficiency. The Rackgo X equips centralized power supplies (PSU) on the rack. All nodes share the centralized power supplies providing lower capital cost and high energy efficiency. Serviceability and Easy Maintenance Designed for easy cold aisle operation most service parts are tool-less and can be replaced in the front aisle. The Rackgo X boasts serviceability. Compared to conventional design where each node equips its own power supply unit (PSU) the Rackgo X's centralized PSU in the rack greatly reduces total PSUs. Its vanity-free design eliminates excessive components and reduces the total component number resulting in lower capital cost minimized maintenance efforts and a better mean time between failures (MTBF). Manageability The QCT Rackgo X allows datacenter operators to monitor the hardware status through a single point of contact with its best-in-class easy-to- use management tool. More Compute Storage and Network Switch Options Like the LEGO concept Rackgo X provides modular units to be built on each other. The QCT Rackgo X includes options of compute server microserver JBOD storage and QuantaMesh network switches as the basic building blocks. Customers can choose componenets to fit the specific needs of their datacenter applications. To help customers get started with the Rackgo X open rack solutions quickly QCT offers three rack architectures to suit different types of workloads. Datacenter customers can choose from the three rack configurations or build their own racks. Copyright Â© Hyperscalers AUS HyperScalers. All rights reserved."

Adding a host of new features to target a wide range of workloads the new family of EPYC processors will deliver even better CPU performance and performance per watt and do so on a platform with 2x the throughput of PCIe 4.0 lanes that also has support for 50% more memory channels. For this new platform GIGABYTE has products ready to get the most out of EPYC-based systems that support fast PCIe Gen5 accelerators and Gen5 NVMe drives in addition to support for high performant DDR5 memory. The NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU enables an order-of-magnitude leap for large-scale AI and HPC with unprecedented performance scalability and security for every data center. With NVIDIA AI Enterprise for streamlined AI development and deployment NVIDIA NVLINK Switch System direct communication between up to 256 GPUs H100 accelerates everything from exascale scale workloads with a dedicated Transformer Engine for trillion parameter language models down to right-sized Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitions. Enabled with Automatic Fan Speed Control to achieve the best cooling and power efficiency. Individual fan speeds will be automatically adjusted according to temperature sensors strategically placed in the servers. To prevent server downtime and data loss as a result of loss of AC power we implement SmaRT in all server platforms. When such an event occurs the system will throttle while maintaining availability and reducing power load. Capacitors within the power supply can supply power for 10-20ms which is enough time to transition to a backup power source for continued operation. Smart Crises Management and Protection (SCMP) SCMP is a feature which is deployed in servers with non-fully redundant PSU design. With SCMP in the event of faulty PSU or overheated system the system will force the CPU into an ultra-low power mode that reduces the power load which prevents the system from unexpected shutdown and avoids component damage or data loss. If the ROM that stores the BMC and BIOS fails to boot the system will reboot with the backup BMC and/or BIOS replacing the primary. Once the primary BMC is updated the ROM of the backup BMC will automatically update the backup through synchronization. For the BIOS it can be updated based on user's choice of firmware version. For hardware-based authentication the passwords encryption keys and digital certificates are stored in a TPM module to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to your data. TPM modules come in either a Serial Peripheral Interface or Low Pin Count bus. Clipping mechanism secures the drive in place. Install or replace a new drive in seconds.

        "output": "Rackgo X Rackgo X An Innovative Open Rack Solution Inspired by OCP The cloud is changing at the speed of light. Chief Technology Officers working on datacenter build-out say data growth lack of space and power and cooling issues are their biggest challenges. Conventional datacenter hardware cannot keep up with the growing density and large capacity requirements of datacenter operators who are looking for more efficient and simplified hardware design. QCT's pioneering ideas and engineering excellence help meet their needs. The Rackgo X is a 21\" open rack solution inspired by the Open Compute Project (OCP http://www.opencompute.org/ a project initiated by Facebook in 2011) standard. It is designed to deliver hyperscale datacenter performance for low CAPEX and OPEX with simplicity energy and cooling efficiency high density serviceability scalability and manageability. The Rackgo X is ideally suited for cloud architecture such as cloud service providers or large enterprise datacenters. Increased Efficiency with Unique Open Rack Design The Rackgo X is an open rack solution that integrates QCT's server storage and top-of-rack switch. Meant to optimize capital efficiency its simple and vanity-free design eliminates excessive features that do not contribute to overall performance. The Rackgo X features a wider open rack width of 21 inches. Compared to conventional 19-inch rack solutions it provides higher compute density greater storage capacity and increased airflow which improves cooling efficiency. The Rackgo X equips centralized power supplies (PSU) on the rack. All nodes share the centralized power supplies providing lower capital cost and high energy efficiency. Serviceability and Easy Maintenance Designed for easy cold aisle operation most service parts are tool-less and can be replaced in the front aisle. The Rackgo X boasts serviceability. Compared to conventional design where each node equips its own power supply unit (PSU) the Rackgo X's centralized PSU in the rack greatly reduces total PSUs. Its vanity-free design eliminates excessive components and reduces the total component number resulting in lower capital cost minimized maintenance efforts and a better mean time between failures (MTBF). Manageability The QCT Rackgo X allows datacenter operators to monitor the hardware status through a single point of contact with its best-in-class easy-to- use management tool. More Compute Storage and Network Switch Options Like the LEGO concept Rackgo X provides modular units to be built on each other. The QCT Rackgo X includes options of compute server microserver JBOD storage and QuantaMesh network switches as the basic building blocks. Customers can choose componenets to fit the specific needs of their datacenter applications. To help customers get started with the Rackgo X open rack solutions quickly QCT offers three rack architectures to suit different types of workloads. Datacenter customers can choose from the three rack configurations or build their own racks. Copyright Â© Hyperscalers AUS HyperScalers. All rights reserved."

The current IT environment is plagued with inefficiencies characterized by low asset utilization a fragmented demand for resources duplicative systems unmanageable environments and long procurement lead times. Cloud computing has the potential to play a major part in addressing these inefficiencies and improving service delivery. But Cloud is changing at the speed of light. Chief Technology Officers and Chief Information Officers say Public Cloud adoption presents serious business-limitations around: loss of control security and data sovereignty latency and cost. When asked about the barriers and challenges faced to deliver internal Cloud services CTOs and CIOs identify: project-risk and complexities due to a lack of standardisation risk of vendor lock-in lengthy lead times as well as a high capex. When we asked George Cvetanovski (Founder and CEO of HyperScalers) on the state of the industry He said \"If Cloud-datacenters were like cars each of us would be heavily reliant on a unique vehicle providing us with insight into the root problems of custom one-time engineered outcomes be it from a build-quality and safety perspective a performance and efficiency perspective or an economies of scale and cost savings perspective.\" George continued \"Information Technology's core problem I'm talking about the problem of complexity is being solved simply through standardisation of best practices and through economies of scale. Conventional datacenter hardware cannot keep up with the growing density and large capacity requirements of datacenters that demand more efficient and simplified hardware design. The decision to partner with Quanta QCT- the world's largest Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) and world's largest provider of Open Compute Project (OCP)-compliant hardware was a no-brainer. QCT's pioneering ideas and engineering excellence help meet HyperScalers' and its channel-partners' and their clients' needs.\" CIOs and CTOs in their quest to find the economics and newfound user benefits of Cloud Computing essentially face three possible alternatives: IT's Cloud-Path of Least Resistance = OCP Compliant (proprietry-free) Built Cloud(s). OEM (proprietary) built Clouds came in second followed by Public Cloud service providers. The matrix's finding affirms CIOs' and CTOs' need and preference for delivering their internal customers and even their external customers the full suite of Amazon-like Cloud services only under their full control and without the limitations of the Public Cloud model including: security and data-sovereignty latency and cost. The matrix also affirms CIOs' and CTOs' need and preference for delivering and operating standard Cloud capacity - vanity free of the expensive OEM brand-badges free of the proprietary limitations and free of proprietary lock-ins. About: Open Compute Project OCP was started by Facebook three years ago with a pretty big goal: to build one of the most efficient computing infrastructures at the lowest possible cost. The result is a data center full of vanity free servers which is 38% more efficient and 24% less expensive to build and run than other state-of-the-art datacenters. About: Quanta QCT World's largest Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) a $40B company with over 100K employees.
